## Running solutions

To run solutions, place your inputs in the `inputs` directory, named with the pattern `day_ #.txt`
(e.g., `day_1.txt`, `day_2.txt`, etc.).

To run all available solutions:

```
python solve.py
```

To run the solutions for a specific day (day 4 in this case):

```
python solve.py 4
```
